A C++ program generating Mandelbrot Set using OpenGL, GLFW, GLEW, it also has GLM, but it is not really used as for now.

The bin directory holds a working .exe file. Mac support is planned.

- Use W/S/A/D to move across the plane
- Use Z/X to zoom in/out
- Use Q/E to slowly change the speed of zooming
- Use J/K to rapidly change the speed of zooming
- Use C to reset the speed of zooming
- Use SPACE to reset to the default settings

The handling of OpenGL was based on the [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2) by [The Cherno](https://github.com/TheCherno).
